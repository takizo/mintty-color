# mintty-color
mintty color setting in windows ConEmu using Solarized Theme by [MAVNN](https://github.com/mavnn/mintty-colors-solarized)

Default mintty on ConEmu looks dull. Adding some dark color theme and adjusting for bigger font size. 

# Why Using mintty? 

While running tmux in remote server, other shell/environment doesn't work on scroll up history, and unfortunately only mintty works, due to some shell encoding issues.
